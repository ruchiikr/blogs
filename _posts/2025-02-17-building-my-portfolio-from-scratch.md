# How I Build My Portfolio from Scratch

<img src="/blogs/images/portfolio.jpg" alt="small Intro">

What is a portfolio, A Portfolio is an extended version of a resume which is make like a website by people to list their experiences and skills and in it they also showcase their real examples of work and creativity skills. Recently I made and deployed my portfolio website in GitHub. Being a Full-Stack Development, having a portfolio website is the best way to show my capabilities, skills, projects and experiences. I created my portfolio from scratch and in this blog, I'll share in this blog that how I planned and then deployed my portfolio.

## Why I Needed a Portfolio Website

Before jumping on the process of making the portfolio. There are some reasons that why I needed a portfolio. The reason is:

- **Showing my projects & skills** I wanted a live space to show my work.
- **Learning new technologies** The best way to learn and use new skills is always a personal project.
- **Make networking easier** Rather than simply providing my LinkedIn or GitHub, I wanted to create something different.

## 1. Planning

So, when it's come to planning the first thing which comes in my mind is that what are the sections that a portfolio should have and they are:

- **Home** – A brief introduction.
- **About Me** – What I do, who I am, and what I like.
- **Skills & Experience** – Technologies in which I’ve worked with and my professional journey.
- **Projects** – The projects that i have made during my internships.
- **Blogs** – A place where all my blogs that I will write will be there.
- **Contact** – Ways by which individuals can contact me.

## The Tech Stack

After planning about the section that I am going to have in my portfolio the next thing that comes in my mind is that what I am going to use for designing were:

- **HTML** – To structure the content of my website.
- **CSS** – To style, design, add colors, fonts, and spacing to make my website so it look good.
- **Canva** – To design custom graphics and images.

## Setting Up the Website

After planning and tech stack it's time for coding. I divided my development part into two main phases:

### 1. Writing the HTML

I started with a basic `index.html` file, then to keep it organized I used semantic HTML tags(<header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer>). Then added a navigation menu for easy scrolling between different sections. Then I used **Font Awesome** icons to enhance the visual appearance. I have also added a hero section with a title and a brief introduction to get visitors attention. The about section provided a summary of my experience and skills, while the projects section showcased my work through a ordered grid layout. Lastly, I added a contact section so that visitors could find it easy to contact me.

### 2. Styling with CSS

For designing my website with a clean, modern appearance, I used CSS. I went with a **dark theme** of low contrast so that content is easily visible in the dark background. Also made the navigation bar **fixed and centered**, so users could access it anytime while scrolling.

## Deploying the Website

Once everything was ready, I pushed my code to **GitHub** and used **GitHub Pages** a free and easy way to host static websites. After pushing my code to GitHub, I enabled GitHub Pages in the repository settings, and my portfolio was live!

I also optimized it by:

- Compressed the images to reduce load time.
- Added **meta tags & Open Graph tags** for better SEO.
- Ensuring **mobile responsiveness** by testing on different devices.

## Conclusion

Building my portfolio website from scratch was a fulfilling experience. It helped me use my HTML, CSS skills while creating something that represents my work. If you're thinking about creating one, start simple and make it over time!
